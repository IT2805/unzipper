# Unzipper 📂

## Description ✏️

This Python script was developed out of frustration related to the tedious process of downloading and grading student deliverables.

Before following the **Running the application** below, make sure you place `unzip.py` in the folder with the zipped file.

## Directory Structure 📂

After running the script, the directories `deliverables` and `feedback` are generated. The files contained in these folders are named after each student's username. Use the `.txt` files in the `feedback` directory to easily write student feedback. When you are done giving the feedback, simply `Copy + Paste` the contents of the `.txt` file to the comment section in BlackBoard.
